# Writing an E2E test using Protractor

## Objectives

- Test bound Directives we've created

## Instructions

Using the files we have provided in this repo, edit `spec/Index.spec.js` to test our application.

We should test that we can click on the "Add" button, and that it adds a new contact to the list.

Inside of the `'should add a new contact'` test, setup the following expectations.
+ Total count of contacts should be `4`.
+ The name of the second contact should be 'Tim'.
+ The phone number of the second contact should be '3934203242'.
